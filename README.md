# Simple password manager made in Go

Hi! 

This repository is part of my 100 days of code challenge I am currently on by October 2024. 

I want to disclose that by no means I am an expert in Golang, barely been learning for some months now. So my intentions here are just to focus onto making a functional CRUD project.

If in any case you want to contribute to this, I would be pleased for any new-comer as myself or non-expert Golang developers to join me with this particular concept.

I don't really want to expand too much, but this are my current ideas for potential improvements (non-part of my current challenge):

```
- Terminal UI (i.e bubbletea)
- Only on first execution - Ask for the name of the user and store it locally, so they shall be greeted with their desired name.
- Encode the password as a base64 field, to be less readable right away for non-knoledgable individuals.
- Provide the posibility to startup a new password CSV file.
- Let me know any other idea!
```
